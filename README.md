🚀 Voice-to-Code AI Project – Convert Speech into Code!
I built a Python project that listens to voice commands and automatically generates code using AI! 🎙️➡️💻  

🔹 **How It Works:**  
✅ Uses Speech Recognition to capture voice input  
✅ Detects the programming language (C, Java, Python, etc.)  
✅ Generates accurate code using Hugging Face’s AI model  
✅ Enhances the audio for better recognition  

This can be a game-changer for developers who want a hands-free coding experience! 🤖💡
